	"\0\s[0]They say laughter is the best medicine. \s[4]Well, I'm always stocked up on Pokemon jokes!\e"
	"\0\s[0]You know, being a Pokemon psychologist,\n\s[1]I've mastered the art of interpreting Pikachu's 'pika-pi' language!\e"
	"\0\s[4]I'm a pro at Pokemon battles too!\s[0] Well, in my dreams at least.\e"
	"\0\s[0]Despite being made of electricity, Rotom are actually very squishy to hold when they aren't in an appliance.\e"

	"\0\s[0]Skitty, Glameow, and Purrloin are actually all derived from the same common ancestor.\s[3]\nIt's not that different from how Carbink eventually becomes Diancie, but it's also similar to regional forms in a way.\e"
